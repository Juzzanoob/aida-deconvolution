#Wish list of things to improve/develop for the AIDA project

= Introduction =

There are a number of things we'd love to see improved for AIDA.  Below is a smattering.

= Details =

  # write how-to-use documentation and develop tutorials
  # create a version in Python 3
  # get FFTW working again
  # create a GUI interface
  # recaste the representation/optimization of the kernel/point spread function in a more compact, computationally efficient form
  # create a robust approach to guess the system point spread function in cases where the user does not provide any guess
  # improving the performance of image and point spread function pre-processing/cleaning modules
  # translate some components (TBD) into faster C++ code
  # develop a GPU (graphics processing unit) version of the code
  # explore the use of AIDA to process images from consumer cameras
  # improve automatic hyperparameter estimation scheme for point spread functions of large extent (currently violates approximation assumption and thus requires user-tweaking of the automatic estimates)
  # develop the algorithm further to improve noise suppression, robust myopic decon, leverage inter-frame features in multi-frame image data
