= Introduction =

A brief tutorial on using AIDA with Priithon by F. Marchis.


= Details =

*1. Test if you have Python 2.5 on your machine*

Open an Xterm or Terminal window on your Mac, type "Python". You should see something like this:

_la-fournaise.localin programs> python_

_Python 2.5 (r25:51918, Sep 19 2006, 08:49:130_

_[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5341)] on darwin_
_Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information._
_>>>_
_type "exit()" in Python to get out_

if the first line is "Python 2.5" then go to step 3, else continue to step 2

*2. Python 2.5 Installation and Test*

Install Python 2.5 for Mac OS X (if you don't have it already): http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/

Make sure that this is the default Python on your machine by typing
"python" in a xterm window.  You should see:

_"Python 2.5 (r25:51918, Sep 19 2006, 08:49:13) "_

Type "exit()" to quit

*3. Priithon installation and test*

install Priithon for Python 2.5 for Mac from http://code.google.com/p/priithon/

Put the Priithon directory (called Priithon_25_mac) on my home directory ~/Priithon_25_mac

After installing priithon, test it typing in an xterm window " ~/Priithon_25_mac/priithon_script"

A new window should open with the following text:

_" !!! Welcome to Priithon !!!_
_(Python 2.5 (r25:51918, Sep 19 2006, 08:49:13)  [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5341)] on darwin)"_

*4. Install AIDA*

Unzip the AIDA1.2.2i archive available in the download and copy the directory  AIDA_1.2.2i on your home directory

*5. Test AIDA*

An archive containing a Titan test image can be found in the Download section

unzip this archive in your directory (directory ~/Test_AIDA)

open an xterm window and cd ~/Test_AIDA/Titan_testimage

You will run AIDA typing the following command

~/Priithon_25_mac/priithon_script ~/AIDA_1.2.2i/AIDA.py -S AIDA_Settings.py

AIDA will run for about 6-9 min (depending of the machine)

if everything goes well you should see a new directory called Results/myopic* containing three files in it called Robj Rpsf and *.log

The file called comparison.jpg in the Titan_testimage show what Titan should look like after deconvolution. You can compare it with Robj*fits.
