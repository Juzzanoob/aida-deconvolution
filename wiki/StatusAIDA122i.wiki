==* Known remaining issues on the current version of AIDA *==

AIDA lost the capability to deconvolve images when the PSF and the noisy image do not have the same shape and/or (?) a square shape - Franck M. will test this

AIDA does not deconvolve 3D multi-frames data on Window XP - in progress (Erik/Franck)

AIDA1.2.2i is slower than AIDA 1.1 - due to python/priithon wrapper to FFTW (or the SWIGed C code for costfunction calculation) - in progress (Seb)
